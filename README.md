# Assignment to Push backend code to GitHub

Now that you have created a lot of backend node.js code, it's time to put it under source control on GitHub.

- Create a local git repository from your existing source code
- Create a GitHub remote repository to hold your code
- Create the appropriate .gitignore file locally
- Perform the steps to add your remote repository as the 'origin' for your local repository
- Check-in and push all of your code


## Once completed, send your GitHub repository URL to Kevin/Kenn
